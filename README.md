# Books and authors dataset Analysis
This Github repository provides a notebook to study and analyze books and authors from two different (but related) datasets that can be found on kaggle:
1. __’main.ipynb’__:
> This notebook is the core file of our work. It provides both functions and code to answer Reaserch Questions (RQ), Command Line Question (CLQ), Amazon WebServices Question (AWSQ) and Algorithmic Question (AQ). There are also comments for each question written in MarkDown cells.
2. __’commandline_original.sh’__:
> This script can be run in the command line to print the top 5 series by number of books, along with their titles and ids.
3. __’commandline_original.sh’__:
> This script, as __’commandline_LLM.sh’__ can be run in the command line to print the top 5 series by number of books, along with their titles and ids. It was written with the aid of a LLM.
